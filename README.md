# face-finder

Experiment to see how hard it is to use python to capture a video stream and then find faces within the stream and draw a box around them.  Additional work to then build an encoder to match faces against known images of people if time allows.

End result, plenty of opportunity to build performant face identifiers and then matching systems.
